## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I followed Kevin Powell's(CSS Youtuber) workflow but did not incorporate hsl variants due to time constraints.

I have not coded for a year(oops), so this was a great refresher on CSS Grid and flexbox as well as creating shapes with gradients. 

I'm also learning about the importance of using rem values and this was the first time I incorporated it into code. I also learnt how to justify content with space-between for the summary component.

### Continued development

Moving forward, I'd like to be more precise in making sure that the original design is identical to the coded version.
